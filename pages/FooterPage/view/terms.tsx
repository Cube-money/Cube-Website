            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-800 mb-3">
              Cube provides software tools that help groups operate savings circles by tracking contributions and coordinating transparent payout schedules.
            </p>
            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-800 mb-3">
              Cube is not a bank, is not a lender, and does not provide interest, credit, financial, or investment advice.
            </p>
            <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-800">
              Payouts are handled through user-to-user transfers. When a cycle winner is selected, other members receive reminders to send their contributions directly to the winner using their own Zelle or Venmo accounts. Cube does not hold, process, or transmit funds and is limited to coordinating timing, reminders, and confirmation of payments.
